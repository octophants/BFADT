<h1>Dissolving Physicalities & Extended Bodies</h1>
<br>

<p class="description1">
Dissolving Physicalities & Extended Bodies is a series of hologram projections designed to question the antagonistic relationship between a subject and an object. The project explores the theoretical implications of rejecting physicality as the primary and ultimate paradigm of existence.

<div id="paraclass">
<p class="para2">We are surrounded by objects, matter. Our perception is the filter that analyses our surroundings and compiles a list of objects that we see. All that we see we define as standing in opposition to ourselves. By default we categorize everything as either “I” or “else”.
<br><br>
Seen that way our bodies become the parameters of our existence: I physically am, therefore I am. Our skin becomes more than a body part, it transforms to a conceptual membrane, a border between inside and outside, between “I”, and “else”.  
However sometimes we come upon an element that defies that logic, something that dissolves the border between “me” and “it”. The border vanishes, the skin shifts, dissolves. One ceases to be singular and whole. After all, is that division really accurate? Is skin the border beyond which we can’t extend? Are we always singular?
