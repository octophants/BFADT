<h1>From Roots to Needles</h1>
<br>

<p class="description1">
An interactive visual narrative where the audience may test the value of their decision-making when they play the game, and whether they are able to help the main character resolve the problem in the story.
<br>
<br>
A girl finds herself stranded in a dark room. She cannot understand how and why this happened as she does not remember anything from the previous day. You, as the player, have to try to help character to resolve the problem in order to find the rest of her friends. The goal is to escape without getting caught. Each decision made by you would impact relationships between characters and you may end with a different ending each time. Try not regret your choices.
