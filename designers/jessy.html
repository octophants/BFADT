<h1>BLACK BOX</h1>
<br>

<p class="description1">
"Black Box" is an interactive installation piece that puts the user in a space they may have never felt like they were in before. anxiety, depression, and flashbacks are things that people experience when they have PTSD. People might try to understand what you're going through but the fact is, it's harder to have empathy for a person unless you've been through a similar enough experience to reference to. Black Box puts you into the mind and setting of the survivor. when you choose to leave, you are reminded that although you were just voluntarily able to leave at your own will, a person with PTSD cannot simply just 'walk away' from their memories and experiences that occur with flashbacks. It is my hopes that the user has a newfound empathy for those who suffer with mental illnesses, or what I like to call the "invisible disability".
<br><br>
"Black Box" is a 4'x4' box that a user can go into. Inside, animations are projected.
